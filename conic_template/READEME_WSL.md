If you are develpoing your algorithm in Windows operating system and wish to use GPU in your dockerized algorithm, we strongly recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) for doing so. It can be done by following the official guidelines provided by NVidia: [CUDA on WSL User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html). However, we post here a general tutorial based on our experience with WSL. For this tutorial we are using the [CoNIC baseline algorithm](https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/CoNIC/tree/docker-template/conic_baseline) which has been tested before. So, assuming that you also have your algorithm ready for dockerization, you can follow the below steps to succesfully containerize your algorithms with GPU capability.
